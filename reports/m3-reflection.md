# Milestone 3 Reflection

## Implementations

Below lists app implementations since the end of Milestone 2. All feedback from instructor has been addressed.

### App Functionality

- Made interactive map work on deployed app
- Enabled map to display all categories (instead of just Happiness Score)
- Created 'scroll-proof' side bar for dropdown filters for map and line chart
- Changed 'year' dropdown to a slider
- Had radar chart show tooltips of country names, selected categories and values
- Made tooltip information appear for all points on radar chart

### Data Aggregation and Feature Engineering

- Got rid of duplicate or missing data to ensure accurate data visualizations
- Created custom-scaled data at the front-end for display of radar chart

### App Design

- Made color theme consistent
- Adjusted size of data visualizations for map, line chart and radar chart so information is clearly visible
- Made interative map show a light gray background for unhighlighted countries for geographical information and to minimze unecessary white space
- Made app wording more concise and got rid of uninformative headings

## Features to Be Implemented

If feasible and time permitted, we will implement zooming in and out on the map. However, since the map is large, even without zooming in, all countries can be accessed through tooltips by hovering on them.

## Impact, Limitations & Opportunities

What we do well:

- App is intuitive to use with a well-organized layout
- Data capture relevant information for target users, including areas that matter to individual quality of life and happiness
- Each section of app is clearly distinguished from the rest and navigation is easy
- App offers users to compare data among a variety of criteria of their choice, including categories, regions and years, giving them efficient tools for their data analysis  process

Future improvements:

- Increase interpretability of data as each category is on different scales with different units
- Ensure consistent padding throughout the app and increase padding where necessary
- (If possible) make scrolling down easier when user's cursor is on the map
