## App sketch & brief description

This is a single-page app that allows users to make selections through dropdown menus to compare the world happiness data by following the step-by-step instructions on the page, navigating from the left to right side of the app. Users start by selecting a continent. Upon selection, map will zoom into the continent chosen. They can then choose how many countries they would like to see in the result using an interactive slider, and will be shown line charts of the top countries according to the chosen comparison criteria (e.g. GDP, Life Expectancy, etc). Then, continuing further to the right of the page, users can select through dropdown menus the top 5 most important comparison criteria and the countries they would like to see compared, and a radar chart will be shown at the bottom right. Countries of different continents can be selected for comparison. Tooltips showing data point values on hover are available on all charts and the map and users can navigate to any future or previous steps at any time without having to follow any specific order, if they wish.
